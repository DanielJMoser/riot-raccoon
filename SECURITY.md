# Security Policy

## Security Measures Implemented

This document outlines the comprehensive security measures implemented in the Riot Raccoon e-commerce platform.

### 🔐 Environment & Configuration Security

#### Environment Variables
- **Secure Storage**: Sensitive credentials are now properly excluded from version control
- **Validation**: Comprehensive validation with security pattern matching for all environment variables
- **Sanitization**: API tokens are sanitized in logs to prevent accidental exposure
- **Development vs Production**: Environment-specific warnings for mismatched configurations

#### Configuration Files
- `.env` file is properly gitignored
- `.env.example` template provided for secure setup
- Runtime validation prevents application startup with invalid credentials

### 🛡️ Content Security Policy (CSP)

#### Browser Security Headers
- **CSP**: Comprehensive Content Security Policy implemented via Netlify headers
- **XSS Protection**: X-XSS-Protection header enabled
- **Content Type**: X-Content-Type-Options set to nosniff
- **Frame Protection**: X-Frame-Options set to DENY
- **HSTS**: HTTP Strict Transport Security enforced in production

#### Allowed Sources
- **Scripts**: Self + PayPal domains only
- **Styles**: Self + Google Fonts only
- **Images**: Self + Sanity CDN + PayPal only
- **Connections**: Restricted to necessary APIs only
- **Frames**: PayPal iframe allowed for checkout only

### 🔒 Input Validation & Sanitization

#### Client-Side Validation
- **XSS Prevention**: Comprehensive HTML/JavaScript sanitization
- **SQL Injection**: Pattern-based SQL injection prevention
- **Input Validation**: Email, phone, name, address validation with security patterns
- **Form Security**: Secure form handling with validation middleware

#### Data Sanitization
- All user inputs are sanitized before processing
- Response data sanitization to prevent stored XSS
- Recursive sanitization for nested objects

### 🚦 Rate Limiting & API Security

#### Request Throttling
- **Client-Side Rate Limiting**: 100 requests per minute per identifier
- **API Wrapper**: Secure API client with built-in rate limiting
- **CSRF Protection**: CSRF token generation and validation
- **Request Headers**: Security headers added to all API requests

#### API Security Measures
- **Same-Origin Policy**: Credentials only sent to same-origin requests
- **Referrer Policy**: Strict referrer policy enforcement
- **Response Validation**: Security header validation on responses

### 🔐 Authentication & Payment Security

#### PayPal Integration
- **Environment Validation**: Sandbox/live environment validation
- **Payment Data Validation**: Client-side payment data validation
- **Secure Checkout**: PayPal iframe with CSP restrictions
- **Transaction Validation**: Payment amount and currency validation

#### Data Protection
- **No Credit Card Storage**: No credit card data stored locally
- **Payment Processing**: All payments processed through PayPal's secure platform
- **Order Security**: Order data validation and sanitization

### 🌐 Network Security

#### HTTPS Enforcement
- **Automatic Redirect**: HTTP to HTTPS redirect in production
- **HSTS**: HTTP Strict Transport Security headers
- **Secure Connections**: All API connections use HTTPS

#### CORS Configuration
- **Same-Origin**: Default same-origin policy
- **Trusted Domains**: Only trusted domains allowed for resources
- **API Restrictions**: API calls restricted to necessary endpoints

### 🔍 Security Monitoring

#### Runtime Security
- **Environment Validation**: Startup validation with security checks
- **Error Handling**: Secure error handling without information leakage
- **Console Logging**: Production console.log removal
- **Security Initialization**: Comprehensive security setup on app start

#### Development vs Production
- **Development Features**: Additional logging and debugging in development
- **Production Hardening**: Security features enabled in production only
- **Environment Warnings**: Automatic warnings for security misconfigurations

### 📱 Mobile Security

#### Capacitor Security
- **Native Features**: Secure native feature access
- **Device Security**: Right-click prevention in production (optional)
- **Session Management**: Automatic session cleanup on app close

### 🛠️ Dependency Security

#### Vulnerability Management
- **Automated Audits**: Regular npm audit checks
- **Dependency Updates**: Timely security updates
- **Vulnerability Fixes**: All known vulnerabilities resolved (0 vulnerabilities as of implementation)

### 📚 Security Best Practices

For developers working on this project:

1. **Never commit sensitive data** to version control
2. **Always validate and sanitize** user inputs
3. **Use HTTPS** for all external communications
4. **Keep dependencies updated** and audit regularly
5. **Follow the principle of least privilege** for API access
6. **Test security measures** in development and staging
7. **Monitor security logs** and implement alerting
